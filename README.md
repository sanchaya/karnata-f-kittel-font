# Karnata F-kittel Font
Karnata F Kittel font is a digital revival of an existing foundry typeface created in erstwhile Basel Mission Press Mangalore between 1830-1900. This font is an attempt to re-create the typeface that resembles a lot with the "Kannada Long primer No 2" which was supposedly created with the supervision of master founder George Plebst at Basel Mission Press, Mangalore. The font has been named after lexicographer, linguist & philologist Ferdinand Kittel (1832-1904) as a mark of honour to his immense scholarly contribution to the Kannada language.
